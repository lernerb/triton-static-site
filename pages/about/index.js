            We started out as structural steel painters based out of Tarpon Springs, Florida. Eventually we moved to NJ and continued painting bridges in the tri-state area. After a while, we started our own painting company out of Fair Lawn, NJ where we live with our family. We have multiple years of experience with painting from sandblasting, painting steel bridges and towers, as well as painting commercial and residential buildings. We started in this industry in 1999, and our business is 100% family owned and operated.</div>
