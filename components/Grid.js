The wall looks fantastic. Such great service that I called him shortly after to complete another job for us. He is now our preferred vendor! You wonâ t go wrong hiring them for your work!          "

          review="I recently bought a house that required some exterior TLC. Peter was straightforward and explained what I needed and what can wait. Originally hired Peter to power wash first and minor exterior trim. He did such a great job I asked him to do my whole deck and other exterior paint/stain.. Peter is hands on and stays on top of his crew."

Peter and his crew were meticulous and made sure that every facet of the exterior be it mailbox, shutters, trim, gutters, and railings looked fantastic. They made this old home look new. We are so happy with the work we will be hiring them to paint the inside of the house.          "

          review="The team provided high quality work, including interior and exterior painting. They had a extremely get it done attitude, going above and beyond on weeds removal and other road blocks that came along the way. They worked relentlessly day after day up to completion and were instrumental on the colors selection. They also provided guidance on roof and gutters issues. We are very pleased with Triton deliverables and our house looks beautiful!          "

He is able to take on many projects such as painting, restoring and renovating a wood deck and replacing old concrete curbs around the driveway with Belgian blocks. His prices are fair and he is ready to shop around to get value for money. I liked his work and can highly recommend him."

We also trusted his opinions on color combinations which really worked out well. The job was exterior painting of a 3000 SF house and staining of a large deck.          "
